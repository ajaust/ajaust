### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Parallel and Distributed Systems at the University of Stuttgart. As part of my work, I am a member of the collaborative research center [SFB1313](https://www.sfb1313.uni-stuttgart.de/) where I work on efficient parallel black-box coupling methods for porous-medium applications. This work includes studying, developing, implementing and evaluating of numerical methods. I love to learn new things, solve (hard) problems, and interdisciplinary work.

Some of my work you can find online here on GitHub. I am also developing a [DuMuX-preCICE adapter](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-appl/dumux-precice) which resides on [DuMuX](https://dumux.org/)' GitLab instance. I am passionate about good and sustainable software engineering. Consequently, Benjamin Uekermann [:octocat:](https://github.com/uekerman/uekerman) and I have developed a new course called [Simulation Software Engineering](https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io/homepage/).

If you are interested more in my research work, please checkout my homepage <https://jaust.net/> and the links on the homepage.
